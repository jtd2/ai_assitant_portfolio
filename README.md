# AI Assitant Portfolio by J.T. Duchamp

## BRIEF SUMMARY

This is a compilation of all of the AI models that I have done so far. Here, I have attached files of Python Programs produced and the scripts needed to run in order to produce AI models. As of this collection, I have created two AI Programs using Telegram as the User Interface. They are running permanently on PythonAnywhere. For security reasons, the OpenAI and Telegram API keys have been censored. I self taught myself the concepts of how a Generative AI Assistant should operate and how the data affects a specific AI model. Feel free to view these Python scripts to see for yourself the projects that I have done.
